We are trying to start a monthly event in Portland inspired by <a href="https://wafflejs.com/>Waffle.JS</a> and <a href="http://brooklynjs.com/">Brooklyn.JS</a>

The idea is to make the event:
- Entertaining
- Inclusive
- Informative (but not too informative, see the first bullet ;) )

Brooklyn.JS and Waffle.JS do an spectualar job of doing this! Each event sells about 60-100 tickets (priced between $10-15). All leftover money after the event gets donated to a non-profit. Talks usually fall into three categories: creative/design, passion, and techincal. Events remain alcohol neutral with non-alcoholic options. Waffle.js has live performers at the event and both events also have kareoke after the talks. Both events have gotten very popular in their respective communities and usually sell out quickly.


We'll use this repo to plan venue, sponsors, and the website for the event. Eventually I'd like to get a Slack channel for us to collaborate in.

TODO:
- Pick name
- Make website
- Generate hype
- Reach out to potential sponsors
- Find venue

If you'd like to get involved, check out some of our open issues where we are discussing venues, sponsorships, etc. Or reach out to me on twitter @emplums!
