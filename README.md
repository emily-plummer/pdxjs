We are trying to start a monthly event in Portland inspired by <a href="http://wafflejs.com/">Waffle.JS</a> and <a href="http://brooklynjs.com/">Brooklyn.JS</a>

The idea is to make the event:
- Community based - I'd love to see this grow into a community rather than just a monthly event
- Entertaining
- Inclusive
- Informative (but not too informative, see the first bullet ;) )

Brooklyn.JS and Waffle.JS do a spectacular job of doing this! Each event sells about 60-100 tickets (priced between $10-15). All leftover money after the event gets donated to a non-profit. Talks usually fall into three categories: creative/design, passion, and technical. Events remain alcohol neutral with non-alcoholic options. Waffle.js has live performers at the event and both events also have karaoke after the talks. Both events have gotten very popular in their respective communities and usually sell out quickly.


We'll use this repo to plan venue, sponsors, and the website for the event. Eventually I'd like to get a Slack channel for us to collaborate in.

Areas we need help in:
- Finding awesome speakers
- Helping land ~3 sponsors for our first event
- Generating hype
- A/V expertise! What equipment do we need to have for our speakers? I'd be great to find someone
  who can also help at the event setting up speakers, mics, projector, etc.
- Finding the perfect venue!

If you'd like to get involved, check out some of our open issues where we are discussing venues, sponsorships, etc. Or reach out to me on twitter [@emplums](http://www.twitter.com/emplums)!
